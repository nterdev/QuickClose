# QuickClose
Stop all the bandwidth sucking apps on your Windows laptop when you decide to tether from your cell phone. 

Quick close is a Windows batch file that will use the task manager to kill apps that you want to close quickly. 

I needed this because I was tired of individually closing every single app, like dropbox, google drive, etc... when I needed to tether data from my phone. Had found out the hard way some of these app are sucking huge amounts of data.

Feel free to modify for the apps you want to quickly close. 

Follow the same pattern and  use task manager to find the process name that you want to kill.

Hope it's helpful!  I'm using it right now as I type this description.
